# certchecker
Fed up with expired SSLs that block systems.<br>
I wanted a system that warns me when a cert is about to expire. Or that tells me when some certs are at risk (e.g. weak encryption or algo)<br>
<br>
Three steps:<br>
1: Make a python proggy that parses SSLYZE outputs and update a DB<br>
2: Make a web interface.<br>
3: Make a scheduler to send alerts and reports<br>
<br>
2022 04 14 Step #1 is done. <br>
2022 04 20 Working on step #2. <br>
  Main page interface is done. <br>
2022 04 30 Working on step #2 <br>
  Site management is done <br>
2022 05 04 Working on Step #2 <br>
  Certificate security settings is almost done. <br>
